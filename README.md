# Object-Detection-using-Google-AI-Open-Images

In this problem we identified multiple objects such as woman, man, guitar, fast-food, train, etc. within an image. We used YOLO (You Only Look Once), a real-time object detection convolutional neural network, to transfer learn and train on ~300K images of data. Considering the size of our data set (~120 GB) it was practically impossible for us to train the Neural Network on our machines. We thus used Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to train our model for ~10 hours.
